# Para

This same project is to be used for all of exercises 9, 10, 11, and 12. All four exercises are similar in content (in that they all use ForkJoin), and so only three will count towards your exercise grade. In other words, your lowest one of these exercises will be dropped (in addition to dropping the two next lowest assignments). Or another way to phrase this, three total exercises will be dropped, where one of those three will be the lowest of exercises 9, 10, 11, and 12. This means you're also welcome to consider one of these four to be optional.

## Setting up

Clone this repo, edit it locally, and push and submit to Gradescope, exactly as in P1. You should submit it multiple times, in each of the Gradescope assignments. You should use Java 11 when
working on this.

You should only edit:

1. HasOver.java (for Exercise 9)
1. GetLongestSequence.java and SequenceRange.java (for Exercise 10)
1. GetLeftMostIndex.java (for Exercise 11)
1. FilterEmpty.java (for Exercise 12)

and do not change the method signature. Feel free to add private
methods as you see fit. Please read the comments in each file for instructions.

## Grading

We will be running an autograder to grade your submission. All the tests are public, so your final grade on Gradescope will be
what goes into the gradebook. The points will be weighted more heavily on your code running properly in parallel and the stress tests.
