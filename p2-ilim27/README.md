# CSE 332 Project 2




The purpose of this project is to implement various data structures and algorithms described in class. You will also implement the back-end for a chat application called ‚ÄúuMessage‚Äù.

## Overview
One of the most important ADTs is the Dictionary and one of the most studied problems is sorting. In this assignment, you will write multiple implementations (AVLTree, HashTable, etc.) of Dictionary and multiple sorting algorithms. 

All of these implementations will be used to drive word suggestion, spelling correction, and autocompletion in a chat application called uMessage. These algorithms are very similar to the ones smartphones use for these problems, and you will see that they do relatively well with a small effort. Since uMessage has many components and is difficult to test, we will ask you to test your code by writing another client for WordSuggestor.

We have provided the boring pieces of these programs (e.g., GUIs, printing code, etc.), but you will write the data structures that back all of the code we‚Äôve written.


## Project Restrictions
You may not use any of the built-in Java data structures. One of the main learning outcomes is to write everything yourself.
Specifically, do not use these:
"java.util.HashSet"
"java.util.HashMap"
"java.util.LinkedHashMap"
"java.util.LinkedHashSet"
"java.util.TreeSet"
"java.util."
"java.util.ArrayTreeMapList"
"java.util.Stack"
"java.util.LinkedList"
"java.util.PriorityQueue"
etc.

Java is large enough such that there probably will be a data structure somewhere that's not mentioned in this list. Please be sure to comply with the spirit of this list, even if some data structure implementation in Java is not explicitly mentioned here.
HashMap is still fine for your HashTrieMap migrated over from P1.
If it feels like you are skipping a lot of steps with anything imported from Java, you probably shouldn't use it.
You may use the Math package.
You may not edit any file in the cse332.* packages.
You may not edit any of the public interfaces.
The design and architecture of your code are a substantial part of your grade.
Make sure to not duplicate fields that are in super-classes (e.g. size). This will lead to unexpected behavior and failures of tests.

Copy over your code from P1!
This project actually extends on p1 a lot! You will need to overwrite the following with your p1 code:

datastructures.worklists: All your simple WorkLists: ArrayStack, ListFIFOQueue, CircularArrayFIFOQueue
datastructures.dictionaries: Your HashTrieSet and your HashTrieMap

Be sure you do NOT place these in cse332.datastructures.worklists. After you port these files over, CircularArrayFIFOQueue won‚Äôt compile. It defines a type parameter E in CircularArrayFIFOQueue<E> at the top of the class, but you should replace this E with ‚ÄúE extends Comparable<E>‚Äù.
## Provided Code 
cse332.interfaces.misc
DeletelessDictionary.java: Like a Dictionary, but the delete method is unsupported.
ComparableDictionary.java: A DeletelessDictionary that requires comparable keys.
SimpleIterator.java: A simplification of Java‚Äôs Iterator that has no remove method.
cse332.datastructures.*
Item.java: A simple container for a key and a value. This is intended to be used as the object stored in your dictionaries.
BinarySearchTree.java: An implementation of Dictionary using a binary search tree. It is provided as an example of how to use function objects and iterators. The iterators you write will not be as difficult

uMessage.java: This is the main driver program for uMessage.

You will implement data structures MinFourHeap and MinFourHeapComparable, MoveToFrontList, AVLTree, and ChainingHashTable and sorting algorithms HeapSort, QuickSort, and TopKSort.
uMessage
After you have finished all the implementations, you will be ready to try out uMessage. We expect you to actually play with the application. Importantly, there are configuration settings (n and the corpus) at the top of uMessage.java which you will want to edit.
## Project Checkpoints 
This project will have two checkpoints (and a final due date). A checkpoint is a check-in on a certain date to make sure you are making reasonable progress on the project. For each checkpoint, you will submit code.
For the Checkpoint 1 deadline, you will need to submit the code for items (1) and (2) (All of Part 1, and the first item in Part 2) to Gradescope. 
For the Checkpoint 2 deadline, you will need to submit the code for items (3), (4) and (5) (all from Part 2) to Gradescope. 
5% of your total grade for Project 2 will be determined by what you submit for the two checkpoints (2.5% each). To receive full credit for a checkpoint you need to be passing all of the tests we have provided in Gradescope. If you are not passing all tests for items at the time the checkpoint is due, please submit what you have at that time for partial credit for the tests you are passing. Please be sure to have ALL items working by the final P2 Due Date, as points will still be awarded for passing the test cases provided at that time. Note: late days may not be applied to Checkpoint deadlines, only to final project due dates.

Checkpoint 1: 
(1), (2) due
Checkpoint 2:
(3), (4), (5) due
P2 Due Date: 
(6), (7) due

### Part 1: Another WorkList 
First, implement one more WorkList:
(1) MinFourHeapComparable
Your MinFourHeapComparable should be an implementation of the heap data structure we‚Äôve discussed in class. It should be an array-based implementation which starts at index 0. Unlike the implementation discussed in lecture, it should be a four-heap (not a two-heap). In other words, each node should have four children, not two. All operations should have the efficiencies we‚Äôve discussed in class:

Operation
Worst-case Runtime
Peek min
ùí™(1)
Delete min
ùí™(n)
Insert
ùí™(n) (amortized)
...
...


Note: Take a look at the generics handout when initializing the array in the MinFourHeapComparable data structure. 

### Part 2:  Implementing Dictionary Classes and Sorts
(2)  MoveToFrontList: Another Dictionary
In this part, you will implement MoveToFrontList, a new type of Dictionary. 

For the remainder of the Dictionary classes you will implement, we will not ask you to write delete‚Äìit is possible (and you can do it for fun), but it‚Äôs not educational enough to be part of the actual project. As a result, your Dictionary classes will inherit from DeletelessDictionary which is the same as Dictionary except it does not require that you implement a delete method. 

MoveToFrontList is a type of linked list where new items are inserted at the front of the list, and an existing item gets moved to the front whenever it is referenced (e.g. in find or insert). Although it has ùí™(n) worst-case time operations, it has a very good amortized analysis. 

You will also be implementing an Iterator for this Dictionary. The runtime for all Iterator operations should run in ùí™(1). We will not be discussing iterators in class so if you need, you can reference the Iterator for BinarySearchTree. 
(3)  CircularArrayFIFOQueue
You might have noticed that we didn‚Äôt finish implementing all the methods in CircularArrayFIFOQueue. If you look in BString, it relies on CircularArrayFIFOQueue having a reasonable definition of equality. In Java, we deal with this by defining an equals method. You may not use toString to implement equals; we expect you to build it from scratch. You might be wondering how to figure out the type of the parameter for equals; in Java, the equals method takes an Object. You will want to do research on the Java instanceof operator.

In addition to equality testing, we also need to be able to compare two Objects. To do this, you should complete the compareTo method in CircularArrayFIFOQueue. You may not use toString to implement compareTo; we expect you to build it from scratch. CircularArrayFIFOQueue backs BString so compareTo should work the same as String's compareTo.

The reason we implement this is that our tree dictionaries in the next part will need to be able to do comparisons instead of equality testing. Remember, in any Dictionary implementation, you may use any of your WorkList implementations
(4) AVLTree: Another Another Dictionary
In this part, you will implement AVLTree. Just like before, you do not have to implement delete. Your AVLTree should be a subclass of BinarySearchTree which we have written for you. You should use an array implementation of left and right children as in BinarySearchTree. Your insert(K key, V value) should run in ùí™((n)). Ensure your rotation code is not repetitive and runs in ùí™((n)).

A note on AVLTree Inheritance. AVLTree extends BinarySearchTree, and BinarySearchTree has a couple methods we might think could be useful: find(K key, V value) and find(K key). Some of you may be trying to use the former find(K key, V value) to access the appropriate spot in your tree without duplicating code, but there‚Äôs actually an issue with this: find(K key, V value) puts BSTNodes in your AVLTree and returns them to you. These nodes can‚Äôt be cast to AVLNode (because they were initialized as BSTNodes), and, since they are BSTNodes, they don‚Äôt have that all-important height field, so you can‚Äôt use them. 

In other words, you should not call the find(K key, V value) method (with a non-null second argument) in BinarySearchTree as part of your insert method. It‚Äôs okay if you end up duplicating some of the find(K key, V value) logic in your insert method. 

You will not need to write a separate find(key) method, though, since the behavior of that method will be the same for both tree types, meaning that the inherited method already behaves correctly. 

Recall that all BSTs rely on a reasonable definition of comparison. Our BST and your AVLTree will both rely on the compareTo that you wrote in the previous part. 
A note on debugging. You can "fail fast" by adding your verifyAvl code as a private helper method, checking validity after every modification to the tree, and throwing an exception if the check fails. This will help you identify which sections of the code are breaking the tree. These checks will be expensive and should be disabled in the final version, but can be helpful when debugging.

Although we do not check your style (such as in the introductory courses), you should still plan your data structure and write many good quality comments for yourself. This is especially true for AVLTree, where we see many students stumble. Plan your data structures now and you can avoid stressful debugging later. If you don't put bugs in, you don't have to take them out.
Here is a nice diagram on all the rotation cases:

(5) ChainingHashTable: Another Another Another Dictionary
In this part, you will implement ChainingHashTable. Just like before, you do not have to implement delete. Your hash table must use separate chaining‚Äìnot probing. Furthermore, you must make the type of chain generic. In particular, you should be able to use any Dictionary implementation as the type inside the buckets. 

Your ChainingHashTable should rehash as appropriate (use an appropriate load factor as discussed in lecture), and its capacity should, for a constant number of cases, be a prime number (use the provided hardcoded list of primes). There shouldn‚Äôt be a cap on how large your hash table can grow: past the last provided prime number, you should resize your table using some other mechanism of your choosing (while still maintaining expected runtimes).

The toString method for your ChainingHashTable has not been implemented although it‚Äôs not required for you to do so. It may be helpful to output a meaningful representation of your table here as it helps with debugging. 

Recall that all Hash Tables rely on a good hashCode. Just like you needed to define equals and compareTo for various other data structures, you will need to define hashCode in CircularArrayFIFOQueue for ChainingHashTable. You may not use toString to implement hashCode; we expect you to build it from scratch. Use this book (sign in with your UW email to gain access) as a resource. In particular, the section that starts with "A good hash function tends to produce‚Ä¶" is most helpful.

At some point, you will want to test various types of chains in your ChainingHashTable. It is confusing to do this initially; so, we have provided some examples in the NGramTester class.
(6): Full Circle!
Now that you have written your own hash map, replace the dependency on Java‚Äôs HashMap with your ChainingHashTable! This is not only okay, it‚Äôs a great example of unexpected refactoring. Refactoring will usually set off a chain reaction where you also have to edit other code. 

You will want to look at the SimpleEntry javadoc (you are allowed to import and use the SimpleEntry class). Remember that you may edit any class that is not in a cse332.* package. 

Here is a general guide on what to change: 

First, work on refactoring HashTrieMap. Red squiggly lines should start appearing in IntelliJ, and you can follow those compiler errors as guidance of what to fix next.
You will eventually need to fix AutocompleteTrie.java as part of your refactor.
Some methods (namely delete) might become impractical to implement with your ChainingHashTable. In this case, it is okay to throw a UnsupportedOperationException.
You will notice a mismatch between the type of Iterator returned from ChainingHashTable and the one that you need in HashTrieNode. This is an example of a common issue you run into while refactoring code
You‚Äôll need to add a (small) bit of code to HashTrieNode/HashTrieMap to work around this type mismatch. You can do it using what you‚Äôve already learned about iterators.
Note that you shouldn‚Äôt modify the ChainingHashTable.iterator() return type, because then it wouldn‚Äôt match the Dictionary interface, and you also shouldn‚Äôt add superfluous Iterator methods to ChainingHashTable to solve a problem in HashTrieMap. 

You have now written pretty much all of the data structures that you‚Äôve used from Java‚Äôs library! You now understand all the magic under the hood! Take a minute to bask in the glory that is data structures nirvana.
(7) MinFourHeap and The Sorts
The MinFourHeapComparable you wrote before was only able to compare elements in a single way (based on the compareTo). There is a more general idea called a Comparator which allows the user to specify a comparison function. The first thing you should do in this part is implement MinFourHeap to use a Comparator. You can copy the logic from MinFourHeapComparable and modify the logic to use a Comparator instead of compareTo. Make sure to modify the array type such that it no longer extends Comparable. This is necessary to make the sorts (below) work. 

NOTE: Take a look at the generics handout when initializing the array backing the MinFourHeap data structure

After you‚Äôve edited MinFourHeap, you will be ready to write the following sorting algorithms: 
HeapSort: Consists of two steps:
Insert each element to be sorted into a heap (MinFourHeap)
Remove each element from the heap, storing them in order in the original array.
QuickSort: Implement quicksort. As with the other sorts, your code should be generic. Your sorting algorithm should meet its expected runtime bound.
TopKSort: An easy way to implement this would be to sort the input as usual and then just print k largest of them. This approach finds the k largest items in time ùí™(n(n)). However, your implementation should have ùí™(n(k)) runtime, assuming k is less than or equal to n. TopKSort should put the top k elements in the first k spots in the array, and all the other indices should be null. In other words, if A=Quicksort(B) for some array B, then: TopKSort(k, A)=[A[n‚àík], A[n‚àí(k‚àí1)],, A[n‚àí1], null, null,, null]. 

Hint: There are many ways to go about TopKSort, but the key idea is to use a heap and never put more than k elements into it. Think about why this gives ùí™(n(k)) runtime bound! In the case that k > array.length, you can simply set k = array.length and proceed with the algorithm (remember to check this!).

### Part 3: uMessage
Now that you are done with all of the coding for the project, you are ready to attempt to run uMessage. This may expose problems with code you wrote earlier. Do not wait until the last minute for this step!

Note: uMessage connects to a live server and you will be able to talk to others who are working on the assignment at the same time. When using uMessage, our course policy requires that you use your CSE or UWNetID as your username. This is a fun program to play around with (please do!) but anyone found using the system to annoy or harass others will be referred to the appropriate conduct offices.

Before you run uMessage, you will want to do the following: 
Increase the allowed heap size in IntelliJ. In particular, uMessage runs significantly more smoothly if you give it 6144MB (6GB) of memory.
Make sure your laptop is plugged in (Yes, this will make a difference.)

There are several variables at the top of uMessage which you can edit: the corpus, the ‚Äún‚Äù, the ‚Äúinner dictionary‚Äù and the ‚Äúouter dictionary‚Äù. If you leave the corpus as eggs.txt, the suggestions will be garbage. If you leave the inner and outer dictionaries as tries, uMessage will probably be too slow. The point of uMessage is that it is a cool application that uses all of the code you wrote. uMessage is a good stress test for P2. 

If any problems occur in uMessage, it is very likely to be a problem with one of your data structures. If this occurs, refer back to the P1 Spec about fuzzy testing.

Once you start working on uMessage, the word suggestions you get in uMessage should be sorted by frequency (conditioned on the previous words), with highest frequency on the left and lowest frequency on the right. Note that inputs with apostrophes may not work, (e.g. can‚Äôt, wouldn‚Äôt), and throw an SSLPeerUnverifiedException. This is a bug in uMessage and you can just ignore it.

As a simple example, with irc.corpus, the words suggested as first words on a newly-opened chat with nothing typed should be ["i", "and", "yeah", "well"], in that order, since those are the four words with the highest frequency at the start of a line, with "i" being the most frequent of the four. 



Trying to debug issues with your ordering code on irc.corpus will take a long time (since this corpus takes a while to load), so it might be a good idea to make a simple test corpus with only a few sentences where you can work out what the suggested words should be.

If you want to debug on a smaller corpus, replace irc.corpus with eggs.txt before running uMessage. You should see [‚Äúnot‚Äù] as the only suggestion when you first open the chat window and nothing typed in.
On gradescope if you are failing the uMessage tests and don't know where to start debugging, looking at the test name can help you figure out where your issues lie. For example, if you are failing the test simple_HashTable_HashTable, then there is something wrong with your hashtable implementation. And if you are failing the test simple_HashTable_HashTable_topk then there is something wrong either your hashtable or topksort.
NGramToNextChoices
NGramToNextChoicesMap will map NGrams to words to counts.

Let‚Äôs walk through an example to better understand this. Suppose that the n in n-gram is 2 and the following are the contents of our input file:

Not in a box.
And not in a house.


The key set of the outer map will contain all of the 2-grams in the file. That is, it will be:
{"not in", "in a", "a box", "box SOL", "SOL and", "and not"}

Notice several interesting things about the output: 

All input is standardized by removing non- alphanumeric characters converting everything to lowercase
The word SOL has been added at the beginning of every line except the first one. SOL, which stands for ‚Äústart of line‚Äù, is inserted by uMessage so that individual pieces of the corpus do not get mushed together. 
‚Äúa house" does not appear in the outer map; the reason for this is that there is nothing after it to include!

The ‚Äútop level‚Äù maps to another dictionary whose keys are the possible words following that n-gram. So, for example, the keys of the dictionary that ‚Äúin a‚Äù maps to are {‚Äúbox‚Äù, ‚Äúhouse‚Äù}, because ‚Äúbox‚Äù and ‚Äúhouse‚Äù are the only two words that follow the 2-gram ‚Äúin a‚Äù in the original text.

Finally, the values of the inner dictionary are a count of how many times that word followed that n-gram. So for example, we have:

"not in"={a=2}, because the word a follows the 2-gram not in twice
"in a"={box=1, house=1}, because box and house each only appear once after ‚Äúin a‚Äù

The entire output for the sample input file above looks like:

"not in"={a=2}, "in a"={box=1, house=1}, "a box"={SOL=1}, "box SOL"={and=1}, "SOL and"={not=1}, "and not"={in=1}


The order of the entries does not matter (remember, dictionaries are not ordered), but the contents do.
Stress Test UMessage
We suggest testing out your various dictionary implementations by swapping out the data structures used in uMessage. In WordsSuggestor.java, NGramToNextChoicesMap is constructed with two dictionaries, an outer and inner. The outer type is the map from NGrams to words; the inner type is the map from words to counts. 

You can change these dictionary types. For example, to initialize an NGramToNextChoicesMap with the outer dictionary as ChainingHashTable and inner dictionary as MoveToFrontList, we would write:

new NGramToNextChoicesMap(() -> new ChainingHashTable(), () -> new MoveToFrontList());


The () -> X notation tells Java to make a function that takes no arguments and returns the thing on the right.

Hint: If you run into bugs when using your Trie as the inner or outer dictionary, we suggest looking at the hashCode() and equals() method of your CircularArrayFIFOQueue. Because when using a Trie, the words in your NGramToNextChoicesMap are AlphabeticStrings which extend CircularArrayFIFOQueue. Do not worry about any bugs you see when using Tries for both your inner and outer dictionaries; uMessage may break because Tries are too slow in this case.
## Submission and Grading
Submission instructions can be found on the Handouts page of the website. We will grade based on correctness of code (given tests + hidden tests) and manual grading on whether you are following the spec. There will be no grading on style (such as in the introductory course) but we suggest writing comments to help yourself understand your code and to help us grade your implementation.
